# 100DaysofCode-Color-Palette-Site
Day 92 of the 100 Days of Code course. Goal for this course was to create a Flask app that displays the most common colors for a picture that is processed.

The goal for this project was to create a flask application that processes a picture that is submitted and returns the top colors that make up that image.

For my spin on the project, I created a website that loads with a sample picture and lists 10 colors by default. On the page, there is an option for a user to upload a picture as well as configure the number of colors returned. This can be from 1-20 colors.

If a picture is not uploaded or an invalid file type is uploaded, the page is reloaded with the default sample picture, and the default number of colors to return (10).

Site was tested with .jpg, .png and other file types. Sample and test picture are included in the assets folder. Sample picture is from Pexels.com and the test picture is a picture I took inside the griffith observatory in Los Angeles.
